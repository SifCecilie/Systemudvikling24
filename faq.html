                                To stay safe while hiking, it’s essential to inform someone about your plans, be aware of your surroundings, stay on marked trails, pack necessary safety equipment, and follow weather forecasts.

                                Choosing the right hiking boots involves considering factors such as terrain, ankle support, comfort, and durability. It’s recommended to try on different boots and ensure a proper fit before making a decision.

                            <p>
                                To prevent blisters, it’s essential to wear well-fitting and moisture-wicking socks, break in your hiking boots beforehand, use blister prevention products, and stop to address any hotspots before they become blisters.

                            How do I handle altitude sickness? ↓

                            <p>
                                Ascend gradually. Avoid traveling from a low elevation to an elevation higher than 2,750 meters above sea level in one day. If possible, spend a few days at 2500–2750 meters before traveling to a higher elevation. This gives your body time to adjust to the lower oxygen levels.
                                <br><br>Medicines are available to prevent acute mountain sickness and shorten the time it takes to get used to high elevations. Talk to your doctor about which is best for you given your medical history and trip plans.

                            What are the signs of dehydration, and how can I prevent it while hiking? ↓
                        </h2> 
                            <p>
                                Signs of dehydration include thirst, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and decreased urine output. Prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your hike. Carry a sufficient amount of water and hydrate regularly. If you come across the mountain steams, you can fill up your waterbottle, but REMEMBER to use purification tablets, or boil the water

                            <p>
                                Consider your fitness level, experience, and the difficulty rating of the trail. Start with trails that match your current fitness level and gradually increase the difficulty as you build strength and endurance.

                            <p>
                                Yes, for some of the less difficult ones it is definitely possible. We recommend they’re at least 8 years old and in good physical condition. We don't recommend you travel with kids on the trail if they aren't accustomed to regular hiking and lost of physical exertion.

                            <p>
                                Yes, this is very important. We recommend that you bring 300 to 400 Peruvian soles. It is possible that you may not need any of this money, but just in case of an emergency you should make sure to have plenty of cash. 
                                <br><br>If you are struggling on the route, you can use the money to purchase alternative forms of transportation such as: car, horse, and train. On some routes, there are a couple of extra activities along the way including hot springs.
